# Proteomics Introductions

There is a recent tutorial by 
[Steven Shuken (2023) on massspetrometry-based proteomics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00838), I enjoyed reading.

Lennart Martens has an introduction to Proteomics [lecture series on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy1SwrMzhYk&list=PLXxp6nsBenSX_W8DiOocKJ0laNauYNdYl), which I used to get started.

An introduction I have seen live in 2020 was from the OpenMS team from TÃ¼bingen at the EuBICs developer
meeting in Nyborg, where you can find the [recordings on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnS-w8ggEAA&list=PL_6fafgzU1nHd13qqjm3uNvyHh62JpPcB&index=2&t=0s).
