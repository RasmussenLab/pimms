Most ideas will be logged using the issues of the repository.

## Clustering Hela data

## Imputation
See if there is literature how to impute missing data in the field of proteomics.
For missing values on the dependent variable zero inflated models have been 
developed. Maybe there is similar things for having yero values.

## Pride cell lines
Select one other cell line which is on Pride processed by MaxQuant. See how 
it compares?!

- number of proteins overlapping of different share of most abundant?
- non-overlapping proteins: most abundant by cellline 
    (DDA fails to find peptides reliably in every run)

## DDA workflow
The preprocessing over raw datafiles needs to be done uniquely 
having the samples from different sources. Select a DDA workflow 
in order to process raw data.
