[![Read the Docs](https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/pimms)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pimms/) [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/RasmussenLab/pimms/ci.yaml)](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/actions) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pimms/badge/?version=latest)](https://pimms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


PIMMS stands for Proteomics Imputation Modeling Mass Spectrometry 
and is a hommage to our dear British friends 
who are missing as part of the EU for far too long already
(Pimms is a British summer drink).

The publication is accepted in Nature Communications 
and the pre-print is available [on biorxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.12.523792).

> `PIMMS` was called `vaep` during development.  
> Before entire refactoring has been completed the imported package will be `vaep`.

We provide functionality as a python package, an excutable workflow or simply in notebooks.

For any questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/issues) or contact me directly.

## Getting started

The models can be used with the scikit-learn interface in the spirit of other scikit-learn imputers. You can try this using our tutorial in colab:

[![open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RasmussenLab/pimms/blob/HEAD/project/04_1_train_pimms_models.ipynb)

It uses the scikit-learn interface. The PIMMS models in the scikit-learn interface
can be executed on the entire data or by specifying a valdiation split for checking training process.
In our experiments overfitting wasn't a big issue, but it's easy to check.

## Install Python package

For interactive use of the models provided in PIMMS, you can use our
[python package `pimms-learn`](https://pypi.org/project/pimms-learn/).
The interface is similar to scikit-learn.

```
pip install pimms-learn
```

Then you can use the models on a pandas DataFrame with missing values. You can try this in the tutorial on Colab by uploading your data:
[![open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RasmussenLab/pimms/blob/HEAD/project/04_1_train_pimms_models.ipynb)

## Notebooks as scripts using papermill

If you want to run a model on your prepared data, you can run notebooks prefixed with 
`01_`, i.e. [`project/01_*.ipynb`](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/tree/HEAD/project) after cloning the repository. Using jupytext also python percentage script versions
are saved.

```bash
# navigat to your desired folder
git clone https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms.git # get all notebooks
cd project # project folder as pwd
# pip install pimms-learn papermill # if not already installed
papermill 01_0_split_data.ipynb --help-notebook
papermill 01_1_train_vae.ipynb --help-notebook
```
> :warning: Mistyped argument names won't throw an error when using papermill, but a warning is printed on the console thanks to my contributions:)

## PIMMS comparison workflow and differential analysis workflow

The PIMMS comparison workflow is a snakemake workflow that runs the all selected PIMMS models and R-models on 
a user-provided dataset and compares the results. An example for a publickly available Alzheimer dataset on the 
protein groups level is re-built regularly and available at: [rasmussenlab.org/pimms](https://www.rasmussenlab.org/pimms/)

It is built on top of
  - the [Snakefile_v2.smk](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/blob/HEAD/project/workflow/Snakefile_v2.smk) (v2 of imputation workflow), specified in on configuration
  - the [Snakefile_ald_comparision](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/blob/HEAD/project/workflow/Snakefile_ald_comparison.smk) workflow for differential analysis

The associated notebooks are index with `01_*` for the comparsion workflow and `10_*` for the differential analysis workflow. The `project` folder can be copied separately to any location if the package is installed. It's standalone folder. It's main folders are:

```bash
# project folder:
project
│   README.md # see description of notebooks and hints on execution in project folder
|---config # configuration files for experiments ("workflows")
|---data # data for experiments
|---runs # results of experiments
|---src # source code or binaries for some R packges
|---tutorials # some tutorials for libraries used in the project
|---workflow # snakemake workflows
```

To re-execute the entire workflow locally, have a look at the [configuration files](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/tree/HEAD/project/config/alzheimer_study) for the published Alzheimer workflow:

- [`config/alzheimer_study/config.yaml`](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/blob/HEAD/project/config/alzheimer_study/comparison.yaml)
- [`config/alzheimer_study/comparsion.yaml`](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/blob/HEAD/project/config/alzheimer_study/config.yaml)

To execute that workflow, follow the Setup instructions below and run the following command in the project folder:

```bash
# being in the project folder
snakemake -s workflow/Snakefile_v2.smk --configfile config/alzheimer_study/config.yaml -p -c1 -n # one core/process, dry-run
snakemake -s workflow/Snakefile_v2.smk --configfile config/alzheimer_study/config.yaml -p -c2 # two cores/process, execute
# after imputation workflow, execute the comparison workflow
snakemake -s workflow/Snakefile_ald_comparison.smk --configfile config/alzheimer_study/comparison.yaml -p -c1
# If you want to build the website locally: https://www.rasmussenlab.org/pimms/
pip install .[docs]
pimms-setup-imputation-comparison -f project/runs/alzheimer_study/
pimms-add-diff-comp -f project/runs/alzheimer_study/ -sf_cp project/runs/alzheimer_study/diff_analysis/AD
cd project/runs/alzheimer_study/
sphinx-build -n --keep-going -b html ./ ./_build/
# open ./_build/index.html
```

## Setup workflow and development environment

### Setup comparison workflow

The core funtionality is available as a standalone software on PyPI under the name `pimms-learn`. However, running the entire snakemake workflow in enabled using 
conda (or mamba) and pip to setup an analysis environment. For a detailed description of setting up
conda (or mamba), see [instructions on setting up a virtual environment](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/blob/HEAD/docs/venv_setup.md).

Download the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms.git
cd pimms
```

Using conda (or mamba), install the dependencies and the package in editable mode

```
# from main folder of repository (containing environment.yml)
conda env create -n pimms -f environment.yml # slower
mamba env create -n pimms -f environment.yml # faster, less then 5mins
```

If on Mac M1, M2 or having otherwise issue using your accelerator (e.g. GPUs): Install the pytorch dependencies first, then the rest of the environment:

### Install pytorch first

> :warning: We currently see issues with some installations on M1 chips. A dependency
> for one workflow is polars, which causes the issue. This should be [fixed now](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/njab/pull/13) 
> for general use by delayed import 
> of `mrmr-selection` in `njab`. If you encounter issues, please open an issue.

Check how to install pytorch for your system [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started).

- select the version compatible with your cuda version if you have an nvidia gpu or a Mac M-chip.

```bash
conda create -n pimms python=3.9 pip
conda activate pimms
# Follow instructions on https://pytorch.org/get-started: 
# CUDA is not available on MacOS, please use default package
# pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio fastai -c pytorch -c fastai -y
pip install pimms-learn
pip install jupyterlab papermill # use run notebook interactively or as a script

cd project
# choose one of the following to test the code
jupyter lab # open 04_1_train_pimms_models.ipynb
papermill 04_1_train_pimms_models.ipynb 04_1_train_pimms_models_test.ipynb # second notebook is output
python 04_1_train_pimms_models.py # just execute the code
```

### Let Snakemake handle installation

If you only want to execute the workflow, you can use snakemake to build the environments for you:

> Snakefile workflow for imputation v1 only support that atm.

```bash
snakemake -p -c1 --configfile config/single_dev_dataset/example/config.yaml --use-conda -n # dry-run
snakemake -p -c1 --configfile config/single_dev_dataset/example/config.yaml --use-conda # execute with one core
```

### Troubleshooting

Trouble shoot your R installation by opening jupyter lab

```
# in projects folder
jupyter lab # open 01_1_train_NAGuideR.ipynb
```

## Run example

Change to the [`project` folder](./project) and see it's [README](project/README.md)
You can subselect models by editing the config file:  [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms/tree/HEAD/project/config/single_dev_dataset/proteinGroups_N50) file.

```
conda activate pimms # activate virtual environment
cd project # go to project folder
pwd # so be in ./pimms/project
snakemake -c1 -p -n # dryrun demo workflow, potentiall add --use-conda
snakemake -c1 -p
```

The demo will run an example on a small data set of 50 HeLa samples (protein groups):
  1. it describes the data and does create the splits based on the [example data](project/data/dev_datasets/HeLa_6070/README.md)
     - see `01_0_split_data.ipynb`
  2. it runs the three semi-supervised models next to some default heuristic methods
     - see `01_1_train_collab.ipynb`, `01_1_train_dae.ipynb`, `01_1_train_vae.ipynb`
  3. it creates an comparison
     - see `01_2_performance_plots.ipynb`

The results are written to `./pimms/project/runs/example`, including `html` versions of the 
notebooks for inspection, having the following structure:

```
│   01_0_split_data.html
│   01_0_split_data.ipynb
│   01_1_train_collab.html
│   01_1_train_collab.ipynb
│   01_1_train_dae.html
│   01_1_train_dae.ipynb
│   01_1_train_vae.html
│   01_1_train_vae.ipynb
│   01_2_performance_plots.html
│   01_2_performance_plots.ipynb
│   data_config.yaml
│   tree_folder.txt
|---data
|---figures
|---metrics
|---models
|---preds
```

The predictions of the three semi-supervised models can be found under `./pimms/project/runs/example/preds`.
To combine them with the observed data you can run

```python
# ipython or python session
# be in ./pimms/project
folder_data = 'runs/example/data'
data = vaep.io.datasplits.DataSplits.from_folder(
    folder_data, file_format='pkl')
observed = pd.concat([data.train_X, data.val_y, data.test_y])
# load predictions for missing values of a certain model
model = 'vae'
fpath_pred = f'runs/example/preds/pred_real_na_{model}.csv '
pred = pd.read_csv(fpath_pred, index_col=[0, 1]).squeeze()
df_imputed = pd.concat([observed, pred]).unstack()
# assert no missing values for retained features
assert df_imputed.isna().sum().sum() == 0
df_imputed
```
